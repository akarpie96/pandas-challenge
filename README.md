# Conclusions: 

1) Charter schools outperform District schools, achieving higher math and reading scores on average, as well as showing substantially higher passing rates in math, reading, and overall passing %.

2) The data show that smaller sized schools (<585) perform better on average in math and reading, and have higher passing rates in both, as well as having higher passing percentages overall.

3) Schools with smaller spending ranges per student have higher averages in math and reading, and also have higher passing rates in both subjects.
